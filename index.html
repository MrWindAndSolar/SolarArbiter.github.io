<h2>Solar Forecast Arbiter</h2>
<p>Follow the lay of the land. It's most important. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job.

These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. Very easy to work these to death. Let's make a nice big leafy tree. That's the way I look when I get home late; black and blue. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light.

We don't need any guidelines or formats. All we need to do is just let it flow right out of us. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be.

You need the dark in order to show the light. Son of a gun. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs.

You gotta think like a tree. Isn't that fantastic? Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Fluff that up.</p>
